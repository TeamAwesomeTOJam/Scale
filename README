Scale

Make your way to the end goal by using the power of scale to your advantage.

Controls:
Left Click: Move towards the mouse
Right Click: Jump
Scroll Wheel: scale
Shift click: Teleport to mouse (Use only if stuck in world geometry.
This is the honour system)

Technology Used:
Python, Pygame, Pymunk

Unfortunatly the pymunk shared library included is only compiled for 32 bit.
If anyone can find an old pymunk source (version < 4 I think) it would be apprecieated.
For windows you must install 32 bit python and pygame.

Installation and running:
Install Python http://www.python.org/download/
Install Pygame http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml
run main.py
